## API Data Retrieval

- I chose the "Data feed example" (retrieval) test.

- Data was obtained from Google Books API.

- Typescript Based React was used (My experience is with JavaScript based React but challenged myself to do it TypeScript based to match the requirements).

- Responsive for smaller devices. (flexbox, viewport, etc...)

## Running the application

- "npm install" inside:

  - "Api-Data-Retrieval" folder if you do git clone
  - "Api-Data-Retrieval-master" folder if you download as zip

- "npm start" (starts on port 3000)
